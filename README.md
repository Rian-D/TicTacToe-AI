Personal Project - Developed an AI agent to play Tic-Tac-Toe using the Minimax algorithm for decision-making

Technologies Used: Python, Minimax algorithm, Game Theory, Alpha-Beta Pruning

Key Contributions:
- Designed and implemented an AI agent to play Tic-Tac-Toe by recursively evaluating all possible game states using the Minimax algorithm.
- Programmed the game logic, allowing the AI to determine optimal moves to minimize the opponent's chances of winning and maximize its own.
- Integrated alpha-beta pruning to enhance performance by cutting off unnecessary branches in the decision tree.
- Created a GUI for user interaction, providing a platform to visualize the AI's moves.

Skills Acquired:
- In-depth understanding of game theory and the Minimax algorithm.
- Experience with recursive algorithms and optimization techniques such as alpha-beta pruning.
- Interface design using libraries such as Pygame to create interactive games.
